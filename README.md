# First Steps in Quantum Neural Networks

In this initial phase, we delve into the fascinating realm of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN). We will use Google Colab notebooks to reproduce exercises that cover:

1. **Qiskit Ecosystem:**
   - Explore exercises involving the Qiskit ecosystem, an open-source quantum development platform.

2. **Kaggle, Titanic:**
   - Tackle specific exercises related to the Titanic dataset on Kaggle. This exercise will allow us to apply and solidify our knowledge in the field of Quantum Neural Networks.

These notebooks will serve as a practical and applied introduction, helping us familiarize ourselves with key concepts and tools in the exciting field of Quantum Neural Networks.
